Refer to scripts in https://github.com/veliaD/NVMrBuild.git to build and
install the kernel and necessary modules

Set up rc.conf and loader.conf.local to load mlx5ib before mlx5en.

	# kldload nvd nvmrdma
should load the NVMe and NVMr modules.

To connect to a remote controller over RDMA find its IPv4 address, RDMA
port number & SubNQN name (see Discovery below), and pass them to the
hw.nvmrdma.controllers sysctl's attach command e.g.

	# sysctl hw.nvmrdma.controllers=attach:10.1.87.234,4420,FromGUS

To list the controllers just invoke the sysctl without any assignment:

	# sysctl hw.nvmrdma.controllers
	hw.nvmrdma.controllers:
	98099775 10.1.87.194,4420,FromGUS
	98099753 10.1.87.234,4420,FromGUS

To detach a controller pass in the unit-number with the detach command:

	# sysctl hw.nvmrdma.controllers=detach:98099753
	hw.nvmrdma.controllers:
	98099775 10.1.87.194,4420,FromGUS
	98099753 10.1.87.234,4420,FromGUS
	 ->
	98099775 10.1.87.194,4420,FromGUS

To detach all controllers pass in -1:

	# sysctl hw.nvmrdma.controllers=detach:-1
	hw.nvmrdma.controllers:
	98099775 10.1.87.194,4420,FromGUS
	 ->
